## Section 1: Week 11 Reflection
Answer each prompt with 3–5 bullet points:

### Key Takeaways
What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
-  That there will be more expectations added through the next couple of weeks, so don't try to finish the project now. 
-  To take some time to learn about feature engineering.
-  Not to try to make anything too cool, since I don't know what all the end expectations will be. 
- 
- 

### Concept Connections
Which Week 1–10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
- Tkinter seems the easiest thing we've done so far. 
- SQL is actually really fun, but I'm still a bit fuzzy on initiating db's. Need to practice with those. 
- Machine Training is a whole new world, so I need to practice more with that too. 
- 
- 

### Early Challenges
Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
-  Not knowing everything that will be expected to be a part of the end project. 
-  Having some trouble understanding/making a pytest. Will take some time with Youtube. 
-  I set everything up, then realized I forgot to make a Github repo for it. 
- 
- 

### Support Strategies
Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?
- YouTube
- The Cohort
- The Class Calendar

## Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale
List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.

| # | Feature Name | Difficulty (1–3) | Why You Chose It / Learning Goal |
|---|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | City Comparison| 1 |It will be cool to provide users with an auto-random option/ to add responsive features to random outputs|
| 2 |Icons| 2 |To create usable options for users / to add custom animations to outputs|
| 3 |Trend Detection| 3 |Users can use predictions to fuel creativity / to prove to myself I can build it|
| Enhancement |not sure yet (it seems like the enhancement IS the central theme of the project, in which case I want to build a weather prediction tool that helps people choose characters for their Dungeons and Dragons campaigns)|n/a|not sure if I will work alone yet/ hard to determine now|

**Tip:** Pick at least one "level 3" feature to stretch your skills!

## Section 3: High-Level Architecture Sketch
Add a diagram or a brief outline that shows:
- Core modules and folders
- Feature modules
- Data flow between components

```
[Add your architecture diagram or outline here]
```

## Section 4: Data Model Plan
Fill in your planned data files or tables:

| File/Table Name | Format (txt, json, csv, other) | Example Row |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `weather_history.txt` | txt | 2025-06-09,New Brunswick,78,Sunny |
| 'char_features.csv'| csv | race,class,feats,equipment|
| 'char_bios.txt'| txt | title,wealth,fame,perssonality|
|                 |                                |             |

## Section 5: Personal Project Timeline (Weeks 12–17)

## Section 6: Risk Assessment
Identify at least 3 potential risks and how you'll handle them.

| Risk | Likelihood (High/Med/Low) | Impact (High/Med/Low) | Mitigation Plan |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| API Rate Limit | Medium | Medium | Add delays or cache recent results |
|      |                           |                      |                 |

 - My Stepfather got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and is dying. He Starts chemo this week. Makes future schedule uncertain. 
 - I have a lot of doctor's appointments in July. 
 - My daughter isn't showing up to her mental health meetings. 
 - For religious reasons, I don't do certain things on Saturdays, so I have to try to get everything done on Friday nights after class or at the last minute on Sundays. 

 - I will attempt to use work/schedule blocking to get as much done in individual chunks of time as I can. 

## Section 7: Support Requests
What specific help will you ask for in office hours or on Slack/Discord?

- Technical blockers to get them cleared up so I can try to stay ahead of the game.
- What I can help other teammates with. 
- How to plan for upcoming expectations. 
- 

## Section 8: Before Monday (Start of Week 12)
Complete these setup steps before Monday:

- [ ] Push `main.py`, `config.py`, and a `/data/` folder to your repo
- [ ] Add OpenWeatherMap key to `.env` (⚠️ Do *not* commit the key)
- [ ] Copy chosen feature templates into `/features/`
- [ ] Commit and push a first-draft `README.md`
- [ ] Book office hours if you're still stuck on API setup 

 - Sundays are chock full for me, I might just take the point hit and get this stuff in as early as I can after my doctor's appointments tomorrow.
